Returns: this gives back a value. 
	--> Console.log doesn't give any value back. gives undefined because it doesn't return anything.

.split:
	syntax:
	--> var <name> = <stringVariable or something like>.split(param);
example: var myString = "This is my string!";
	 var myArray = myString.split(" ");
--> this should make the string into an array using the .split with the params of spaces to make an array.
answer: when you try to access myArray this is what you get:
	["This", "is", "my", "string!"]
it worked! .split 'returned' an array of strings.

Return Quiz: 
	--> this will return all the locations of your jobs

function locationizer(work_obj) { //work_obj is the object that holds all the information that would go above the function code
	var locationArray = []; //create an empty array that you will fill with the locations. this is good to do beacuse you want to keep the 
				//old information that you gained from each loop
	
	for (job in work_obj.jobs) { //goes through each job in the work_obj object
		
		var newLocation = work_obj.jobs[job].location;
				//work_obj --> the work object
				//.jobs --> jobs array
				//[job] --> the element for each loop
				//.location --> using dot-notation to get the information we need
		locationArray.push(newLocation); // adding the information to the new array
	}

	return locationArray;
}
